### Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹

â€¢ ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him or They/Them

After some years as a musician and a massage therapist I've found my way into programming, and what a wonderful and wild ride it has been.<br>
Some experiences that lead me here:<br>
First, I love beauty in combination with practiality and accessibility.<br>
Second, I started a second business that needed a website, but creating the website I needed was not accessible to me. So I taught myself the skills I needed and pursued further education.
Third, I am a people person through and through and really wanted to be collaborating with other people.
