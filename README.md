â€¢ ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him or They/Them

After some years as a musician and a massage therapist I've found my way into programming, and what a crazy ride it has been.<br>
I've got a beautiful range of experiences that lead me here:<br>
First, I've always wanted to work on a team to create something beautiful AND practical. If you're reading this, you know how practical the skills that you develop as a programmer are.<br>
Second, I started a business that stalled when I got to the web design portion. It was too expensive and I didn't have the know-how to create one by myself. Until now!
